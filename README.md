This is a customization of [FanControl.NvThermalSensors](https://github.com/TimSirmovics/FanControl.NvThermalSensors) plugin for [FanControl](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases) with extra sensors for offsetting VRAM temperatures. 

This might help defining a max temp curve with both GPU and VMEM temperatures when using a GPU with very high temperature VRAM such as RTX3090.

## To install

1. Clone this repo.
2. Compile the solution.
2. Place FanControl.NvThermalSensors.dll into the FanControl "plugins" folder.
